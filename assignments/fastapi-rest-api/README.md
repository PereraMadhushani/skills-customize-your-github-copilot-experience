# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test a simple RESTful API using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints to manage a collection of resources and practice handling HTTP requests and responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project with FastAPI and Uvicorn. Create a basic FastAPI app with a root endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main Python file (e.g., main.py)
- Define a root endpoint (GET /) that returns a JSON welcome message


### 🛠️ Task 2: Implement CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to create, read, update, and delete items in a simple in-memory list (e.g., books, tasks, or users).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for your resource
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages
